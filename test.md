Absolutely, Danny — here’s a detailed step-by-step breakdown of everything we did to get your PySpark + pytest testing environment up and running inside a Pipenv project.

## ✅ Steps to Get PySpark Testing Working with `pytest` in Pipenv

### 🏗️ **1. Project Setup**
- Your Spark application was written in `spark_app.py` and read from Kafka topics using PySpark’s Structured Streaming.
- The code was initially set up to run immediately upon import (which is problematic for testing).

---

### 🔀 **2. Isolate Runtime Logic**
- Wrapped Spark streaming logic inside a `main()` function:
  ```python
  def main():
      ...
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
- This allowed test files to `import` from `spark_app.py` without triggering the Kafka stream.

---

### 🧪 **3. Created Basic Unit Tests**
- Added `test/test_batches.py` with two tests: one for `process_unconfirmed`, one for `process_confirmed`.
- These tests built small DataFrames using `Row()` and called the batch processor functions directly.

---

### 🧰 **4. Set Up Pipenv Environment**
- Ensured `Pipfile` included:
  ```toml
  [packages]
  pyspark = "*"
  kafka-python = "*"
  pyyaml = "*"

  [dev-packages]
  pytest = "*"
  flake8 = "*"
  ```

- Installed all packages:
  ```bash
  pipenv install
  pipenv install --dev pytest
  ```

---

### ☕ **5. Set JAVA_HOME for PySpark**
- Installed Java via:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
  ```

- Found the Java path:
  ```bash
  readlink -f $(which java)
  ```

- Set the environment variable:
  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
  ```

---

### 🪵 **6. Fixed Logging Fallback**
- Wrapped logger initialization in a try block to avoid permission errors when writing logs during tests:
  ```python
  def init_logging():
      try:
          os.makedirs("/mnt/spark/logs", exist_ok=True)
          ...
      except PermissionError:
          logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
          ...
  ```

- Moved `LOGGER = init_logging()` to the **module level** so all functions can access it (including during tests).

---

### 🔥 **7. Resolved Kafka Source JAR Errors**
- When testing, Spark was failing on `.write.format("kafka").save()` due to missing Kafka integration JARs.
- Solved it by **mocking** the `.save()` method in tests:
  ```python
  from unittest.mock import patch

  @patch("pyspark.sql.DataFrameWriter.save")
  def test_process_unconfirmed_happy_path(mock_save, ...):
      ...
      process_unconfirmed(df, batch_id=0)
      mock_save.assert_called_once()
  ```

---

### 🟢 **8. Final Success**
- After these changes, running:

  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run pytest test/
  ```

  Output:
  ```
  test/test_batches.py ..                                              [100%]
  2 passed
  ```

---

## ✅ Final Setup Achieved
- Cleanly testable Spark app using PySpark.
- Unit tests isolated from Kafka and filesystem side effects.
- Testable logic: batch processing functions.
- Runtime-safe design using `main()` protection and top-level `LOGGER`.
